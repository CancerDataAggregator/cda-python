This means that all ```ResearchSubject``` records coming from the same subject are now gathered under the Patient entity. As we know, certain specimens are studied in multiple projects (being part of a single data node or multiple nodes) as different ```ResearchSubject``` entries. Those ```ResearchSubject``` entries are collected as a list under the ```ResearchSubject``` entity. One example of this is the patient record with ```id = TCGA-E2-A10A``` which contains two ```ResearchSubject``` entries, one from GDC and the other from PDC.\n",
